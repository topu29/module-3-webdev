    <h3>Chicken Biriyani</h3>  
    <p>
        Whether you’re talking Arroz con Pollo, Hainanese Chicken Rice, or Oyako Donburi; chicken and rice is a classic pairing that has permeated culinary culture around the world. It makes sense that earlier in human history, this staple seed would be combined with a domesticated source of protein, but the fact that this combination has endured as a popular favorite today, speaks to its unassailable deliciousness. Although widely associated with Indian cuisine, Chicken Biryani is a dish that has spread across a wide swath of South Asia, reaching as far west as Iraq, and as far east as Indonesia. The vast geographical area Biryani calls home has resulted in a huge variety of preparations and ingredients.
        Pulao (a.k.a. Pilaf), a similar rice dish can be found in the same areas. While there’s some debate as to the difference between Biryani and Pulao, the latter tends to have less meat and veggies relative to the rice, which means it’s usually served as a side rather than an entree. The second big difference is that Biryani is usually layered and steamed, which creates a wonderful variation in flavor, texture and color when it’s all mixed together at the end.

    <h3>Yogurt</h3>
    <p>
        I gave Doi recipe before which is very handy but not traditional way. So I am sharing this recipe  to make Bangladeshi Tradition Yogurt / Misti Doi / দই(দধি) in traditional way. If you don’t have or don’t want to go the hassle of boiling milk, you can use evaporated milk. Hope you will make and enjoy with your loved one in this summer.
